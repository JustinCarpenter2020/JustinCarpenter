# TEAMWORK
## Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?

Situation: I was working with a team of 3 other developers on a full stack application, We were participating in a hackathon so we had to remain in close proximity for multiple hours. Members of our group had disagreements and what the MVP of our app should be which stalled the entire process. 

Task: We only had 12 hours to complete this app so we had to resolve the issues and maintain a positive relationship for the rest of the time remaining. 

Action: I suggested to the team that we look at our Figma and lucid chart side by side and write down a single MVP that would be achievable with the time constraints. After writing it down we put it on a whiteboard with a new rule that the MVP must remain the same. 

Resolution: After resolving this issue the team was able to work more efficiently to achieve what now was a fully understood common goal. Taking a step back and really examining what needed to be done helped the team feel more united. 

# COMMUNICATION SKILLS
## Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across to your team.

Situation: When I was working as assistant manager at my first job, I had to rely heavily on written communication in order to maintain a smooth work environment while I wasn’t there. There was a time when all the managers were going to be unavailable for a full day.

Task: It was my responsibility to leave notes as a guide to all the workers. These notes had to be specific enough to have both a morning crew and a night crew know which ones were for them but they also had to cover a wide range of topics like handling money, resolving issues, and emergency contacts.  

Action: I created a color coding system of sticky notes to better distinguish between morning duties and night duties, as well as created a whiteboard that listed important information and the emergency contact/ protocols for the store. Just in case any of this information was lost I added it all into a notebook as a backup for my team.  

Resolution: This through of a solution allowed the management staff peace of mind knowing all the resources and expectations were available to the workers. The workers could easily identify and complete their work and if a problem was to arise they would have a way to solve it.

# MOTIVATION AND VALUES
## Tell me about a time when you worked under close supervision or extremely loose supervision. How did you handle that?

Situation:During a final project for my college english class I was given very little to no supervision to complete a paper and presentation to either pass or fail the class. 

Task: Without supervision I was responsible for working on both sides of the project and having them complete and ready to present by the due date. 

Action: In order to stay organized without a lot of direction I used tools and methods to remain on track. Tools like google calendar to timebox myself, I also created multiple todo lists for every phase of my project from start to finish.  

Resolution: By using these tools I was able to set daily goals and plan more effectively which made the lack of supervision not a problem. 

# TIME MANAGEMENT SKILLS
## Sometimes it’s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?

Situation: I was creating an application with 3 other developers and I found that our phase one goals were fairly overwhelming. 

Task: I was faced with the issue of addressing that I needed support from my team as well as the need to adjust our todos.

Action: I was able to sit down with my team and really address our MVP as well as share my feelings of being overwhelmed. 

Resolution: The result was that my team had a better understanding of my personal situation on the project as well as what needed to change in order to keep our mvp on track. I was able to get the support I needed from my team.

# ABILITY TO ADAPT
## Tell me about the first job you’ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?

Situation: My first Job was a food establishment And one day I was faced with taking an order where I didn’t know the recipe. 

Task: I was responsible for memorizing and repeating multiple recipes back to back, I had to learn these recipes and how to interact with a customer at the same time. But this time I was faced with one I didn’t know

Action: This particular time I tried to look up the recipe in one of the company books and when I couldn’t find it I asked one of my superiors. After hours that day I was also able to research the recipe on the company website which helped my progress in learning immensely.

Resolution: As a result I was able to learn quickly and efficiently while growing relationships with those I asked questions to as well as learning where I could reference to improve on my own.
